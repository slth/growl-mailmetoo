This Growl view plugin was developed in 2011, back when Growl's email capabilities were rather basic. _MailMeToo_ was built to replace the _MailMe_ notification style for those who weren't satisfied by it. Instead of routing notifications through _Mail.app_, _MailMeToo_ would connect to your SMTP server and directly send the notification.

With _Growl 2.0_, _MailMeToo_ was pulled into _Growl_ to replace the original _MailMe_ plugin. For that reason, you don't need to download this plugin anymore, unless for some reason you're using older versions of Growl.

This project contains an Obj-C implementation of the SMTP protocol.
